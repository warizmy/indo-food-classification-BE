```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

### 5. Place the Model File
1. Create a ```models/``` directory in the project's root.
2. Place your trained model file inside this directory

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
Once the setup is complete, run the Flask server from your terminal:
```bash
python app.py
```
